### Alpha Vantage Stock API

A(nother) "work-in-progress" app. I am finding I learn best by doing, so I'm building this app to learn React. Will add to this README as I go...

#### To run locally:

1. Clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Open browser to `localhost:3000` (though it should open automatically)
